alternative title: YOU ARE THE MAP, THERE IS NO TERRITORY

naive rationality says something like:
- you have some goal
- if you have accurate beliefs about reality that will help you achieve your goal
- so clearly you should seek to have accurate belifes

i think this doesn't work. i think normies in particular understand this at an intuitive level, and so don't do the autistic truth-seeking thing. i will try to explain from the autistic frame why this is the case.

the big problem is that beliefs and desires are the same sort of stuff: priors, beliefs, expectations, whatever. 

in some cases the naive/rationalist/autistic model works. for example: 
- i want to buy a laptop: 
- i read about different laptop stats 
- i buy a good laptop

(i say rationalistic/autistic etc with much sympathy, the people thinking this way are very much my ingroup)

but these sort of cases are relatively unimportant in life. the more important cases, the ones we viscerally care about, are more something like:
 - i want people to like me
- for whatever reason i have an bad/awkward/cringe social interaction
- i should update my beliefs in the direction of being bad/awkward, or in the direction of other people sucking
- but if i do that, it will affect my interactions with other people! i will interpret ambiguous neutral social cues slightly negatively - maybe i think the other person's facial expression means they're mad at me. then i get annoyed, they sense that, they get annoyed back, and my prediction came true, my model is validated, people really do suck, they hate me for no reason. 
- and then other bad things follow. we have some hard-coded needs for social validation (or at least things like not being hungry, which social validation etc helps with)
- so instead, i don't make that update. i say 'we cringe on' or 'lol whatever' etc. 

the problem is that, as predictive processing tells us, beliefs are self-fulfilling prophecies, in a deep way. so one one hand your beliefs are about modeling reality accurately, but on the other they're about driving your behavior in a desired way (one which minimizes prediction error from intro-whatever-it's called sources, e.g. makes sure you eat when hungry).

maybe an example would be 'black-pilling' beliefs. maybe you go through some rough shit in life and it would be correct to update in the direction of people being terrible. but, we should expect there to be a bias against this theory, because adopting the belief would change your behavior - you would expect people to suck, so you'd read neutral interactions as bad, people feel that, act more coldly towards you, and some more steps like this until you bottom out in 'hard-coded' predictions about social belonging and having sex and not being hungry and even more low-level hard-coded bodily homeostatis predictions.

claims: incels etc have been mindfucked by the memetic idea of thinking about goals and beliefs in the naive/rationalist/autistic way. your default is correct! your aversion to self-serving beliefs, beliefs which you would adopt for their utility for you instead of their rationalist-truth value, sounds reasonable but is actually dumb. midwit meme sort of situation. 

claims: this is also relevant to the way people discuss intelligence. if you're a object-level autist-type thinker on this subject, you would be wise to understand why normies have an instinctual ick around this topic.

thinking about things this way also makes it easier to understand human sexual development. how come we are attracted to fucking cute girls instead of fucking toasters? in the naive/rationalist/autistic view there should be some truth hard-coded by evolution for us to find. and maybe there is, to some extent. but this is less confusing when you understand that we're not we're not just "discovering" "the truth", we are also choosing how we will behave. and it would suck to be a toaster fucker! so in the 

in fact this point could be generalized a bit, and seen as a source of bias towards conformity in our belief forming. or an argument about why social norms promoting conformity developed - they're necessary to guide ambiguous questions around 'what kind of person am i' in a good direction, in the absence of a good 'objective' source of truth. 

does this help with philosophical problems about like, doing things which change who we are? like if you're a woman and become pregnant and have a child, that will probably change you enough that your desires/goals are notably different afterwards. not sure but this sounds adjacent.+


stress the wisdom of the normie approach 


clearly some people do get black-pilled etc so this bias ins't infinitely powerful.


this is part of 

hm idk.

the claim about normies: they understand the value of adopting a ""not true"" belief primarily for the purpose of how it affects their actions.
