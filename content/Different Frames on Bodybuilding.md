I think the popular evidence based bodybuilding space has more implicit frames and assumptions than is commonly acknowledged. I'd like to try to make some of these assumptions explicit as well as offer some alternative frames I find plausible or under-appreciated.

## The common frame

- predictable
- optimal thing is kind of systematic, routine based, maybe mesocycles

Implicitly this frame also comes with some assumptions about what is not important, or at least less important: non-local systemic factors and hormonal responses to workouts, neural activation and the skill aspect of lifting, psychological difficulty, and whatever "unknown unknowns" I'm not thinking of here.

I'm actually quite uncertain about to what extent this perspective is basically obviously correct and true vs not quite the full story. But I'd like to flesh out some of these alternative frames and ways of looking at what's important and what the most actionable nobs and dials are. 

Take all of these lightly, more as possibilities than confident assertions.
## Systemic factors

This one is probably the second most common one after the previouss frame. It says something like: Direct local muscle stimulus is important but not the whole story, because lifting also has some kind of whole-body systemic impact, through some your hormones or activating some signaling chemicals or whatever else. These then help all your muscle groups grow. The most effective way to get these systemic benefits is through heavy compound lifts like squats and deadlifts, with supplementary or "accessory" work added because some local stimulus is still an important growth signal.
## neural activation, skillmaxxing, calisthenics aligned

The common frame is incomplete because it's ignoring an important contributor to your ability to provide a strong growth stimulus to the muscle, namely your skill, or your ability to really use the muscle fully. Without some skill and neural adaptation you will be unable to lift the weight before the muscle is as cooked as could be, because you're not using it as efficiently as you could, because at the neural level you're literally not "trying" as hard as is possible, and because you're unwillingly activating other irrelevant muscles which are interfering.

You should prioritize mind-muscle connection and do powerlifting-y work where you train your strength in lower rep ranges. You should explicitly think about how effectively you're executing the lift: on one hand it should be hard to provide stimulus for growth, on the other there should be an ease to it because you're doing it efficiently. Potentially you should include some calisthenics as that requires the meta skill of improving at the skill aspect of a lift, with carry-over benefits to your regular lifting.
## reward to effort/difficulty and psychological feasibility, the real bottleneck is willpower

The common frame is incomplete because it neglects the reality of you being a mortal human with finite willpower. With a gun to your head maybe you could perform the theoretically optimal routine which hits all your muscle groups as often as possible as hard as possible. But in reality you can't, because that theoretically optimal routine would be really painful. The real bottleneck is psychological feasibility, so you should pick exercises which have a favorable ratio of reward to difficulty. This probably varies from person to person 

## rest-maxxing and general health

The common frame is basically correct but misleading. Your muscle grows when resting, not in the gym, and actually the largest impact you can have on your gains is through optimizing your rest and general health. This is because building muscle is a luxury, and you must provide your body favorable conditions to indulge in it. Instead of chasing small marginal gains through improving your exercise selection or programming, you should buy black out curtains and avoid late meals and go to bed on a regular schedule. If replacing a gym session with a light run will improve your sleep and general fitness, that's on net better for your gains. Do whatever helps you rest deeper, reduces stress, and improves general health markers like heart rate variability and resting heart rate, and the gains will follow, given a reasonable amount of lifting.

## vibe based reactivity, exercise the muscle when it's ready, personalized-ness

TODO?
## predictive coding and homeostatis and esoteric mind over matter bullshit

(For this to make sense consider reading http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/ and https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/06/predictive-processing-and-perceptual-control/, they are both excellent, as well https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho-Cybernetics for a self-help book explaining this frame from the control theory perspective).

The common frame is wrong about what type of thing a human being is. It models you as an agent making decisions in the world, but really you are a prediction error minimization machine, or a kind of complicated thermostat. You have some set point of where your muscle mass should be, and if you manage to set the set point higher than where it currently is, all the incredibly powerful prediction-error-minimizing and homeostasis-maintaining machinery of your brain will work to get you more muscle, aiming to close the gap through changes in physiology and behavior.

One way to shift your set point of how much muscle you should have is of course through lifting. But that's not the most powerful tool available: you should also be vividly imagining your goal, imagining yourself hitting a new PR in complete detail, shifting your self image towards being bigger and stronger. It's not enough to lift, you must manifest and hyperstition yourself into being jacked. And then in two years it will be done, you just need to get out of the way and let prediction-error-minimization/nature/Spirit/God's grace do its thing through you.
## So what's actually true

So are any of these actually true? 

I expect these frames are some mix of directionally correct and basically wrong and kind of true but operating at a different level of description. And really they can be mixed and matched in different ways. For example if you accept the set-point frame there's still the question of what it's actually optimal to do at the gym. And maybe the systemic factors is kind of correct but actually the main impact is that heavy compounds improve general fitness and health more effectively and the real gains are from the rest-first frame. 

For what it's worth I think the common frame has reasonably broad empirical support, and the systemic factors frame has good evidence against it, at least when focusing on the impact of hormone spikes. I asked Claude for a vibe check of the different perspectives' merits and empirical and theoretical support:

> Each of these frames varies widely in empirical support. The common evidence-based frame—progressive overload, sufficient volume, proximity to failure—has the strongest research backing and is the right starting point. The systemic factors frame (hormone spikes from heavy compounds driving whole-body growth) has been fairly directly tested and largely debunked. The neural/skill frame is real but somewhat orthogonal—motor learning matters more for strength expression than hypertrophy per se. The rest/recovery and psychological feasibility frames are genuinely underrated: adherence and recovery are probably where most people leave the most gains on the table, and the evidence on sleep's effect on muscle protein synthesis is strong. The predictive coding/set-point frame is the most speculative—visualization has some evidence in motor performance contexts, but as a primary hypertrophy driver it's firmly "intriguing but unproven." If I had to rank by impact for someone with a decent program: sleep and recovery first, then psychological sustainability, then refining the common frame basics, with the rest as interesting but lower-leverage.

Which is a very nice and sensible perspective, and likely a good counterbalance to the kind of schizo skeptic energy motivating this post.

So how true are any of these?

Exercises apply local muscle stimulus. Then when you rest 

 
There's some 

- muscle stimulus, rest, local muscle damage,"tension is king", "individual muscle" decomposition

## Alternative frames

### This one
### This other one
### This other one

- systemic factors, hormones, powerlifting
- neural activation, skillmaxxing, calisthenics aligned
- reward to effort/difficulty and psychological feasibility, the real bottleneck is willpower
- rest-maxxing
- vibe based reactivity, exercise the muscle when it's ready
