- surprised by how good it is. 
- my biggest fault with the philosophy presented is that there's too many named concepts. if you introduce 15 different concepts like TODO then you can explain anything you want in a way which sounds convincing. but it's too complicated, these concepts are just not *that* good, definitely not good enough to have 15 of them, it's a house of cards.
- concepts I need to mull over some more:
	- being disliked ~ freedom, and the opposite that 
	- happiness stemming from contribution to the community
	- boundaries. I didn't "get" this when reading Chris Lakin's blog, I want to revisit the idea now. 
	- the causality reversal on things like "you feel shy so that you don't have to ask her out". this rhymes nicely with Lakin's local optimality idea which I think is critical and underappreciated.
- some things rhyme with predictive coding, especially the teleology stuff.
- some points I was unconvinced on:
	- the living in the present stuff. I don't get it. if this is practical advice then for me it wasn't clear enough, and if it's spiritual advice
