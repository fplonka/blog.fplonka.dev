notes are ideas i like and some commentary/thoughts. generally a great blog but here i'm particularly interested in the woo-y self-improvement things. mostly writing this for future me. (and present me, insofar as it's useful to chew on the ideas by writing something about them).

interestingly chris seems to mention quite a few people i've met irl, i think i have a good idea of the circle he's in. 

- don't ask why you feel a way
	- in particular for your own feelings!
- external advice on posture is useless, do gradient descent instead
	- potentially i underestimate in practice how many things are like this, where you really just need to fuck around and find out
- descriptions of depression sound a lot like the sapolsky definition, "condition where you can't enjoy a beautiful sunset"
- "loving because they're essential"
	- in particular the example of how you love your dog or friends
	- on one hand i love this, on the other i hesitate to let go of the 'maxxing' perspective
- bad things we're doing being locally optimal and in at least some sense adaptive - yes yes yes
	- e.g. depression being "useful" in that it's a strategy/solution to the problem of not finding social interaction emotionally safe
- boundaries idea: confused, i don't like it. or i'm retarded.
	- ok, the second post on it explains it better.
- gets predictive coding ðŸ¥°
