An Act&#39;s Moral Goodness Depends on How It Affects Your Character

  <p>Acts have obvious direct consequences. For example shouting at someone in public will make make the person you&rsquo;re shouting at upset. But they also have second-order consequences: by shouting at someone, you contribute to creating the sort of world where people shout at each other. You probably lower social trust, you probably make shouting in public a bit more acceptable. And you become the sort of person who shouts at people.</p>
<p>I think this last type of second-order consequence, where an act contributes very slightly to you becoming a different type of person, is under-appreciated and actually often dominates the moral calculus. And so it&rsquo;s actually quite useless to ask, for example, is it good to punch someone. If you&rsquo;re short-tempered and punch on angry an angry impulse, it&rsquo;s probably bad. If you&rsquo;re a bit of a coward and the punch is a step in the direction of you finally standing up for yourself, potentially it&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>On one hand this is a bit unsatisfying in that it means evaluating the moral goodness of an act is computationally intractable. But on the other, things do be like that sometimes. Some meandering thoughts related to this idea now follow.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-person-does-the-act-make-you-become">What kind of person does the act make you become?</h2>
<p>Ok, so you punched someone. In what way does this change your character? What kind of person does this make you become?</p>
<p>I think this question is slightly doomed, because your brain&rsquo;s black-box deep-learning machinery will do this unconsciously for you, and it will do it in a way which is probably not very amenable to neat interpretation. But attempting anyways, I think two things will be taken into account: the hypothesis&rsquo;s explanatory power and its simplicity.</p>
<p>So if you punched Jack on Tuesday evening, your character changes such that you&rsquo;re the sort of person who punches Jack on Tuesday evenings. But it only moves in this direction a tiny bit, because this hypothesis is so complicated and awkward, even though it explains your behavior quite well. Your character will probably also make</p>
<p>But at a high-level, I think two</p>

<p>As is mandatory for this blog, to answer this question I must first plug the theory of predictive processing. Read <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/">Scott&rsquo;s excellent post for crucial context</a>.</p>

<p>hypotheses are favored based on simplicity and being good explanations</p>

<p>doomed to think about this consciously, this is the domain of black box machine learnign bs</p>

<p>as is mandatory for this blog, i must note that this fits in nicely with the predictive coding paradigm. your &lsquo;self&rsquo; is a model of</p>

<p>As usual for my blog I need to plug predictive coding</p>
