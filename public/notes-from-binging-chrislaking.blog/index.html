<p>notes are ideas i like and some commentary/thoughts. generally a great blog but here i&rsquo;m particularly interested in the woo-y self-improvement things. mostly writing this for future me. (and present me, insofar as it&rsquo;s useful to chew on the ideas by writing something about them).</p>
<p>interestingly chris seems to mention quite a few people i&rsquo;ve met irl, i think i have a good idea of the circle he&rsquo;s in.</p>
<ul>
<li>don&rsquo;t ask why you feel a way
<ul>
<li>in particular for your own feelings!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>external advice on posture is useless, do gradient descent instead
<ul>
<li>potentially i underestimate in practice how many things are like this, where you really just need to fuck around and find out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>descriptions of depression sound a lot like the sapolsky definition, &ldquo;condition where you can&rsquo;t enjoy a beautiful sunset&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;loving because they&rsquo;re essential&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>in particular the example of how you love your dog or friends</li>
<li>on one hand i love this, on the other i hesitate to let go of the &lsquo;maxxing&rsquo; perspective</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>bad things we&rsquo;re doing being locally optimal and in at least some sense adaptive - yes yes yes
<ul>
<li>e.g. depression being &ldquo;useful&rdquo; in that it&rsquo;s a strategy/solution to the problem of not finding social interaction emotionally safe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>boundaries idea: confused, i don&rsquo;t like it. or i&rsquo;m retarded.
<ul>
<li>ok, the second post on it explains it better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>gets predictive coding ü•∞</li>
</ul>
