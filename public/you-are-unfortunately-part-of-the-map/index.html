      <p>alternative title: YOU ARE THE MAP, THERE IS NO TERRITORY</p>
<p>naive rationality says something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have some goal</li>
<li>if you have accurate beliefs about reality that will help you achieve your goal</li>
<li>so clearly you should seek to have accurate belifes</li>
</ul>
<p>i think this doesn&rsquo;t work. i think normies in particular understand this at an intuitive level, and so don&rsquo;t do the autistic truth-seeking thing. i will try to explain from the autistic frame why this is the case.</p>
<p>the big problem is that beliefs and desires are the same sort of stuff: priors, beliefs, expectations, whatever.</p>
<p>in some cases the naive/rationalist/autistic model works. for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>i want to buy a laptop:</li>
<li>i read about different laptop stats</li>
<li>i buy a good laptop</li>
</ul>
<p>(i say rationalistic/autistic etc with much sympathy, the people thinking this way are very much my ingroup)</p>
<p>but these sort of cases are relatively unimportant in life. the more important cases, the ones we viscerally care about, are more something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>i want people to like me</li>
<li>for whatever reason i have an bad/awkward/cringe social interaction</li>
<li>i should update my beliefs in the direction of being bad/awkward, or in the direction of other people sucking</li>
<li>but if i do that, it will affect my interactions with other people! i will interpret ambiguous neutral social cues slightly negatively - maybe i think the other person&rsquo;s facial expression means they&rsquo;re mad at me. then i get annoyed, they sense that, they get annoyed back, and my prediction came true, my model is validated, people really do suck, they hate me for no reason.</li>
<li>and then other bad things follow. we have some hard-coded needs for social validation (or at least things like not being hungry, which social validation etc helps with)</li>
<li>so instead, i don&rsquo;t make that update. i say &lsquo;we cringe on&rsquo; or &rsquo;lol whatever&rsquo; etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>the problem is that, as predictive processing tells us, beliefs are self-fulfilling prophecies, in a deep way. so one one hand your beliefs are about modeling reality accurately, but on the other they&rsquo;re about driving your behavior in a desired way (one which minimizes prediction error from intro-whatever-it&rsquo;s called sources, e.g. makes sure you eat when hungry).</p>
<p>maybe an example would be &lsquo;black-pilling&rsquo; beliefs. maybe you go through some rough shit in life and it would be correct to update in the direction of people being terrible. but, we should expect there to be a bias against this theory, because adopting the belief would change your behavior - you would expect people to suck, so you&rsquo;d read neutral interactions as bad, people feel that, act more coldly towards you, and some more steps like this until you bottom out in &lsquo;hard-coded&rsquo; predictions about social belonging and having sex and not being hungry and even more low-level hard-coded bodily homeostatis predictions.</p>
<p>claims: incels etc have been mindfucked by the memetic idea of thinking about goals and beliefs in the naive/rationalist/autistic way. your default is correct! your aversion to self-serving beliefs, beliefs which you would adopt for their utility for you instead of their rationalist-truth value, sounds reasonable but is actually dumb. midwit meme sort of situation.</p>
<p>claims: this is also relevant to the way people discuss intelligence. if you&rsquo;re a object-level autist-type thinker on this subject, you would be wise to understand why normies have an instinctual ick around this topic.</p>
<p>thinking about things this way also makes it easier to understand human sexual development. how come we are attracted to fucking cute girls instead of fucking toasters? in the naive/rationalist/autistic view there should be some truth hard-coded by evolution for us to find. and maybe there is, to some extent. but this is less confusing when you understand that we&rsquo;re not we&rsquo;re not just &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; &ldquo;the truth&rdquo;, we are also choosing how we will behave. and it would suck to be a toaster fucker! so in the</p>
<p>in fact this point could be generalized a bit, and seen as a source of bias towards conformity in our belief forming. or an argument about why social norms promoting conformity developed - they&rsquo;re necessary to guide ambiguous questions around &lsquo;what kind of person am i&rsquo; in a good direction, in the absence of a good &lsquo;objective&rsquo; source of truth.</p>
<p>does this help with philosophical problems about like, doing things which change who we are? like if you&rsquo;re a woman and become pregnant and have a child, that will probably change you enough that your desires/goals are notably different afterwards. not sure but this sounds adjacent.+</p>
<p>stress the wisdom of the normie approach</p>
<p>clearly some people do get black-pilled etc so this bias ins&rsquo;t infinitely powerful.</p>
<p>this is part of</p>
<p>hm idk.</p>
<p>the claim about normies: they understand the value of adopting a &ldquo;&ldquo;not true&rdquo;&rdquo; belief primarily for the purpose of how it affects their actions.</p>
