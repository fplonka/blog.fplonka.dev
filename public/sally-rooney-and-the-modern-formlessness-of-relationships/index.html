      <p>there used to be stronger guiding ideals / expectations for what relations between people should be like. now things are more formless. you can be fucking and that can mean anything, you can be friends with benefits or a situationship or just dating or long term committed, and then even when you have one of these labels there&rsquo;s a vagueness around what is implied in terms of expectations duties responsibilities. or you can be &ldquo;not putting a label on it&rdquo; - explicit formlessness.</p>
<p>obviously this is good in some ways. freedom to do things how you want! choices in what love means for you! i concede that. but this formlessness is also terrible, absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>the problem is that in the case (todo reword) for formlessness there is an implicit assumption which sounds something like: deep down in you there are your true preferences, the things you really want, which will come out of you give them the space to. i think this is mostly not true. i don&rsquo;t think preferences exist so neatly separate from beliefs / expectations.</p>
<p>some context is required. i&rsquo;m sceptical of this separation because i&rsquo;m big on a theory called predictive coding, which posits that what the brain is doing is just minimising prediction error: being as unsurprised by sensory data as possible. there are two ways to do this. you can update your beliefs to predict sensory data better. or you can act in the world to make what you perceive better match what you expect. beliefs + the prediction error minimisation drive is what causes action!</p>
<p>on this view preferences are expectations about how the world is, and the prediction error minimisation drive is what causes you to act on your preferences. so it&rsquo;s not that you have preferences moulded by societal expectations, it&rsquo;s that the preferences and expectations are made of the same kind of stuff, such that you can&rsquo;t separate one from the other. so what happens once society no longer hands you down strong expectations about how to behave in different relationships?</p>
<ul>
<li>relationships still happens because there are some expectations and also strong bodily hyperpriors for company / sex / intimacy</li>
<li>but it&rsquo;s harder in the most fundamental way possible</li>
<li>but also this makes weird arrangements possible. sally rooney characters commonly end up in some kind of situation where they really care for the relationship, but where there are no preexisting expectations to guide them. but they still try, and try to figure out the roles and expectations for themselves. very respectable that they attempt it - the default zoomer response is inaction, not trying.</li>
<li>these are arrangements which wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without this societal formlessness, they&rsquo;re a microcosm of the beautiful upside of this terrifying freedom. peter at the end of intermezzo is the example i&rsquo;m thinking of here.</li>
</ul>
<p>in so far as you have true deep down preferences, they&rsquo;re the hard-coded homeostasis beliefs: my body is not too hot or too cold, i have this level of oxygen in my blood, etc. that or more regular brain-y beliefs that just go very deep and are hard to dislodge, i do think that&rsquo;s a thing.</p>
<p>fundamentally this is because preferences <em>are</em> beliefs, because what the brain does aj</p>
<p>the framework which makes it explicit is predictive coding.</p>
